This project is aimed at creating an assistant for personal medication management that will help you to correctly follow all your prescriptions. Simply enter your doses and schedules, associate them with your daily routine and let Us do the rest of the work for you, notifying you at the right time so you don't forget.


We offer you:

○ A simple and pleasant interface

○ Medication warnings and reminders, with fully configurable alarms/calendar

○ Flexible medication guidelines, with specific options for control and other medications.

○ Daily control of medicines taken

○ Management of several patients in the same application

# Get Started / Ideas

The idea is a beginning not very loaded but that it has in an image gallery screenshots of the interface with tutorial explanation.

Something friendly since it would be designed for all types of user regardless of budget range since we have many elderly people who would use this tool

How it can be cumbersome, also registering for non-technology friends includes the possibility of connecting with social networks because I believe that even grandparents today have at least Facebook ...

you only need to give it a name in the database and define it as a user

I also think that it would be useful to include a tab about emergency numbers in case of over medication and also clarify that the app is only a calendar

Also in the emergency numbers, it could include a link that leads to the maps where it shows the closest medical centers or pharmacies (I have to see how that is done first but it should not be different from the cell phone)
Once logged in, the nav shows all the functions.
First it allows you to load the medicines, then the calendar but also to keep a record of when you took the medicine.
